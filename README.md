# ScarletBot

This Python script operates a GroupMe bot that post messages to a specified groupme chat.

Once the admin adds in the proper tokens and edits the messages, the script only needs to be ran when new messages need to be released.

I would reccomned using chrontab to release the messages in a consistent time weekly or whatever your use case may be.
