If you'd like a ride to Calvary this Sunday to either the 8:15, 9:45 or 11:15 service, please like the appropriate message and show up to the 507 at 7:45/9:15/10:45 respectively. We will leave at 7:55/9:25/10:55 respectively.
            
If you need to be picked up from another location, feel free to message a driver to pick you up. Keep in mind that for each like a driver gives in a time slot, 4 people can be driven to said service.
            
If a driver cannot make it to a specific service time, we cannot guarentee a ride to that service, and I reccomend you go to another service that has drivers.
            
If no drivers are available or you cannot make it to a service, Calvary will have an online service you may attend: https://yourcalvary.info/livestream""",
